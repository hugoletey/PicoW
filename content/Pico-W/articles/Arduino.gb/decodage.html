        <h3>Decryption</h3>
        <p>
            The Arduino code presented above illustrates the basic principle of the project.
            Here is a detailed explanation of each section of the code:
        </p>
        <pre>
            #include <DHT.h>

            DHT dht(18, 22); // Creating a DHT object with the pin number where the Pico is connected as the first parameter and the type of DHT used as the second.
        </pre>
        <p>
            These lines include the DHT library necessary for interacting with the sensor and define constants for the GPIO pin used and the sensor type (DHT22 in this case).
            An `dht` object is created using the library and the defined constants.
        </pre>
        <pre>
            void setup() {
                Serial.begin(115200); // Initializing serial communication
                dht.begin(); // Initializing the DHT22 sensor
            }
        </pre>
        <p>
            The `setup()` function is executed only once at program startup.
            In this section, serial communication is initialized with a baud rate of 9600, allowing the display of data on the serial console connected to the computer.
            Additionally, the `dht.begin()` function initializes the DHT22 sensor and prepares it for communication.
        </pre>
        <pre>
        void loop() {
            delay(2000);
            float h = dht.readHumidity();
            float t = dht.readTemperature();
            float f = dht.readTemperature(true);
          
            if (isnan(h) || isnan(t) || isnan(f)) {
              Serial.println(F("Reception failed"));
              return;
            }
          
            Serial.print("Humidity: ");
            Serial.print(h);
            Serial.print("% Temperature: ");
            Serial.print(t);
            Serial.print("°C, ");
            Serial.print(f);
            Serial.println("°F");
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
            The `loop()` function is executed in a continuous loop.
            Inside this loop:
          <ul>
              <li>
                  The `dht.readTemperature()` and `dht.readHumidity()` functions are used to read the temperature and humidity values from the DHT22 sensor.
                  These functions return `float` values (floating-point numbers).
              </li>
              <li>
                  A check is performed to ensure that the read values are not NaN (not a number).
                  If they are, an error message is displayed on the serial console indicating a sensor reading problem.
              </li>
              <li>
                  If the values are valid, they are displayed on the serial console using `Serial.print()` and `Serial.println()` statements.
                  The code adds labels for temperature and humidity, and their corresponding units of measurement.
              </li>
              <li>
                  A `delay(2000)` function is used to introduce a 2-second delay between each sensor reading.
                  This delay can be adjusted according to the application's needs.
              </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
  </main>
