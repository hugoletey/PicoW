            <li><h3>Connection of the DHT22 Sensor</h3>
                <p>
                    The DHT22 sensor is connected to the Pico W board using jumper wires.
                    The GPIO pin of the board is connected to the data pin of the sensor, while the

                      <p>
                          It is important to respect the correct pinout to ensure effective communication between the board and the sensor.
                          Technical documentation of the Pico W board and the DHT22 sensor will indicate the specific pins to use.
                          Generally, the data pin of the DHT22 sensor is connected to a GPIO pin of the Pico W board, and power (e.g., 3.3V) and ground pins are also connected.

                  <li><h3>Initialization of the Sensor</h3>
                      <p>
                          The Pico W board uses the MicroPython programming language.
                          To interact with the DHT22 sensor, it is necessary to include a specific software library.
                          The project code imports the DHT library and uses it to create an object that represents the connected DHT22 sensor.
                          This initialization allows the Pico W board to recognize and communicate with the sensor.
                      </p>
                  </li>
                  <li><h3>Data Reading</h3>
                      <p>
                          Once the sensor is initialized, the Pico W board can send requests to retrieve the temperature and humidity values.
                          The DHT22 sensor uses a serial communication protocol to transmit digital data.
                          The project code uses functions from the DHT library to send a read command to the sensor and receive the data in response.
                      </p>
                  </li>
                  <li><h3>Data Processing</h3>
                      <p>
                          The data received from the DHT22 sensor is initially in digital form.
                          The project code uses functions from the DHT library to convert these numerical values into standard measurement units, typically degrees Celsius (Â°C) for temperature and percentages (%) for relative humidity.
                      </p>
                  </li>
                  <li><h3>Data Display</h3>
                      <p>
                          The final temperature and humidity values, converted into understandable units, need to be displayed to the user.
                          Depending on the project setup, the display can be done in different ways:
                          <ul>
                              <li>
                                **Serial Console:** The project code can print the values to the serial console connected to the computer, allowing simple data visualization during development and testing.

                              <li>**LCD Screen:** An LCD screen can be connected to the Pico W board to directly display the temperature and humidity values on a screen.</li>
                              <li>**Web Interface:** The code can be extended to send the data to a web server, allowing the values to be viewed remotely via a web browser.</li>
