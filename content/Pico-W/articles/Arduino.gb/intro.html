            <p>
                This project details the design and implementation of a temperature and humidity detection system using the Raspberry Pi Pico W board and the DHT22 sensor.
                Programmed in C-ARDUINO via the Arduino IDE, this system offers a simple and effective solution for measuring and displaying real-time temperature and humidity values, thus contributing to environmental monitoring in a practical and accessible way.
                With an approach focused on simplicity and reliability, this project aims to provide an adaptable and cost-effective solution for a range of applications from home monitoring to large-scale environmental data collection.
                In this tutorial, we will briefly detail the components that have been used and the operation of the code.
