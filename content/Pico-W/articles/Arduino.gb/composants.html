            <li><h3>DHT22 Sensor (AM2302)</h3>
                <p>
                    The DHT22 sensor is an economical and accurate digital sensor that measures both temperature and relative humidity. It communicates with the Pico W board via a serial communication interface and offers the following features:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Temperature measurement range: -40°C to 80°C</li>
                        <li>Humidity measurement range: 0% to 100%</li>
                        <li>Temperature accuracy: ±0.5°C</li>
                        <li>Humidity accuracy: ±2% RH</li>
                        <li>Low power consumption</li>
                        <li>Simple serial communication interface</li>
                    </ul>

            </li>
            <li><h3>Jumper Wires</h3>
                <p>
                    Jumper wires are flexible connection cables that allow establishing electrical connections between the Pico W board and the DHT22 sensor. They are available in different lengths and colors, and their use facilitates prototyping and circuit wiring.

            <li><h3>Computer with USB Port</h3>
                <p>
                    A computer is required to program the Pico W board and to display temperature and humidity data. The computer must have a USB port to connect the Pico W board and development software compatible with MicroPython.
                    <p><strong><span style="color: red;"><u>Note:</u> It is essential to always flash the memory of the PICO W when handling it in order to upload another code.</span></strong></p>
