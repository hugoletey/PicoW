            <h2>Operation</h2>
            <p>
                The temperature and humidity detection system operates according to the following steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>**Connection of the DHT22 Sensor:**
                    <p>
                        The DHT22 sensor is connected to the Pico W board using jumper wires. 
                        The board's GPIO pin is connected to the sensor's data pin, while the
                        <li>**Connection of the DHT22 Sensor (continued):**
                          <p>
                              It is important to respect the correct pinout to ensure effective communication between the board and the sensor. 
                              Technical documentation of the Pico W board and the DHT22 sensor will indicate the specific pins to use. 
                              In general, the data pin of the DHT22 sensor is connected to a GPIO pin of the Pico W board, and power (e.g., 3.3V) and ground pins are also connected.
                          </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>**Sensor Initialization:**
                          <p>
                              The Pico W board uses the MicroPython programming language. 
                              To interact with the DHT22 sensor, it is necessary to include a specific software library. 
                              The project code imports the DHT library and uses it to create an object representing the connected DHT22 sensor. 
                              This initialization allows the Pico W board to recognize and communicate with the sensor.
                          </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>**Data Reading:**
                          <p>
                              Once the sensor is initialized, the Pico W board can send requests to retrieve temperature and humidity values. 
                              The DHT22 sensor uses a serial communication protocol to transmit numerical data. 
                              The project code uses functions from the DHT library to send a read command to the sensor and receive the data in response.
                          </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>**Data Processing:**
                          <p>
                              The data received from the DHT22 sensor is initially in numerical form. 
                              The project code uses functions from the DHT library to convert these numerical values into standard units of measurement, typically degrees Celsius (°C) for temperature and percentages (%) for relative humidity.
                          </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>**Data Display:**
                          <p>
                              The final temperature and humidity values, converted into understandable units, need to be displayed to the user. 
                              Depending on the project configuration, the display can be done in various ways:
                              <ul>
                                  <li>**Serial Console:** The project code can print the values to the serial console connected to the computer, allowing simple data visualization during development and testing.</li>
                                  <li>**LCD Screen:** An LCD screen can be connected to the Pico W board to directly display temperature and humidity values on a screen.</li>
                                  <li>**Web Interface:** The code can be extended to send data to a web server, allowing the values to be viewed remotely via a web browser.</li>
                              </ul>
                          </p>
                      </li>
                  </ol>

                  <h2>Arduino Code Breakdown</h2>
                  <p>
                      The Arduino code presented above illustrates the basic principle of the project. 
                      Here is a detailed explanation of each section of the code:
                  </p>
                  <pre>
                      #include &lt;DHT.h&gt;
      
                      #define DHTPIN 13 // GPIO pin to which the DHT22 sensor is connected
                      #define DHTTYPE DHT22 // Type of DHT22 sensor
      
                      DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE); // Creating a DHT object
                  </pre>
                  <p>
                      These lines include the necessary DHT library to interact with the sensor and define constants for the GPIO pin used and the sensor type (DHT22 in this case). 
                      A `dht` object is created using the library and the defined constants.
                  </pre>
                  <pre>
                      void setup() {
                          Serial.begin(9600); // Initializing serial communication
                          dht.begin(); // Initializing the DHT22 sensor
                      }
                  </pre>
                  <p>
                      The `setup()` function is executed only once at program startup. 
                      In this section, serial communication is initialized with a baud rate of 9600, allowing the display of data on the serial console connected to the computer. 
                      Additionally, the `dht.begin()` function initializes the DHT22 sensor and prepares it for communication.
                  </pre>
                  <pre
                  void loop() {
                    // Reading temperature and humidity values
                    float temperature = dht.readTemperature();
                    float humidity = dht.readHumidity();

                    // Checking if values are valid
                    if (isnan(temperature) || isnan(humidity)) {
                        Serial.println("Error reading DHT22 sensor!");
                        return;
                    }

                    // Displaying values on the serial console
                    Serial.print("Temperature: ");
                    Serial.print(temperature);
                    Serial.print(" °C");
                    Serial.print(" Humidity: ");
                    Serial.print(humidity);
                    Serial.println(" %");

                    delay(2000); // 2-second delay between readings
                }
            </pre>
            <p>
                The `loop()` function is continuously executed in a loop. 
                Within this loop:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The `dht.readTemperature()` and `dht.readHumidity()` functions are used to read temperature and humidity values from the DHT22 sensor. 
                            These functions return `float` values (floating-point numbers).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A check is performed to ensure that the read values are not NaN (not-a-number) values. 
                            If they are, an error message is displayed on the serial console indicating a sensor reading problem.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the values are valid, they are displayed on the serial console using `Serial.print()` and `Serial.println()` statements. 
                            The code adds labels for temperature and humidity and their corresponding units of measurement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A `delay(2000)` function is used to introduce a 2-second delay between each sensor reading. 
                            This delay can be adjusted according to the application's needs.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </p>
