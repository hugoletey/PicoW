<h1>MicroPython Basics</h1>

<h2>Syntax and Structure of MicroPython:</h2>
<p>MicroPython syntax and structure are quite similar to Python, making it easy for Python developers to transition to MicroPython. Here are some key points:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Indentation:</strong> Like Python, MicroPython uses indentation to denote blocks of code. Consistent indentation is crucial for the proper functioning of the code.</li>
  <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Comments in MicroPython are denoted by the '#' symbol, similar to Python.</li>
  <li><strong>Case Sensitivity:</strong> MicroPython is case-sensitive. Variables and function names must be referenced with the correct capitalization.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Working with the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):</h2>
<p>The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive shell environment provided by MicroPython that allows you to execute commands and evaluate expressions directly. Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Accessing the REPL:</strong> After connecting your MicroPython-enabled device (such as Raspberry Pi Pico) to your computer, you can access the REPL through a serial connection using terminal software like PuTTY (Windows) or screen (macOS/Linux).</li>
  <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> Once in the REPL, you can enter Python/MicroPython commands and see their output immediately. This makes it great for testing small snippets of code, experimenting with hardware peripherals, and debugging.</li>
  <li><strong>Exiting the REPL:</strong> To exit the REPL, you can typically use a specific key combination (e.g., Ctrl + D) or command (e.g., `Ctrl + ]` in PuTTY) depending on the terminal software you're using.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Variables, Data Types, and Basic Operations:</h2>
<p>MicroPython supports various data types and operations similar to Python:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Variables are used to store data. They can hold different types of data, including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Types:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Integers:</strong> Whole numbers without decimal points.</li>
      <li><strong>Floats:</strong> Numbers with decimal points.</li>
      <li><strong>Strings:</strong> Sequences of characters enclosed within single or double quotes.</li>
      <li><strong>Lists:</strong> Ordered collections of items, which can be of different data types.</li>
      <li><strong>Tuples:</strong> Immutable ordered collections of items.</li>
      <li><strong>Dictionaries:</strong> Unordered collections of key-value pairs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Basic Operations:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arithmetic Operations:</strong> Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Exponentiation (**), Modulus (%), Floor Division (//).</li>
      <li><strong>Comparison Operators:</strong> Equal to (==), Not equal to (!=), Greater than (>), Less than (<), Greater than or equal to (>=), Less than or equal to (<=).</li>
      <li><strong>Logical Operators:</strong> AND (and), OR (or), NOT (not).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Here's an example of using MicroPython to perform basic operations:</p>
<pre>
<code># Variables and basic operations
x = 5
y = 3

# Arithmetic operations
addition_result = x + y
subtraction_result = x - y
multiplication_result = x * y
division_result = x / y
modulus_result = x % y

# Comparison operations
greater_than_result = x > y
less_than_result = x < y

# Logical operations
logical_and_result = (x > 0) and (y < 0)
logical_or_result = (x > 0) or (y < 0)

print(addition_result, subtraction_result, multiplication_result, division_result, modulus_result)
print(greater_than_result, less_than_result)
print(logical_and_result, logical_or_result)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Understanding these basics will provide you with a solid foundation for working with MicroPython and developing applications for embedded systems and microcontrollers.</p>
