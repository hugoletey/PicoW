<h2>Exploring Raspberry Pi Pico W and C Language</h2>
<h3>Introduction to Raspberry Pi Pico W:</h3>
<p>Raspberry Pi Pico W is a microcontroller board developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, evolving from the original Raspberry Pi Pico 
    version. It features a compact design and harnesses the power of the internal RP2040 microcontroller chip from the Raspberry Pi 
    Foundation. Equipped with built-in wireless capabilities such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, hence the "W" in its name, the Pico W offers 
    extended connectivity, making it ideal for a variety of IoT (Internet of Things) applications.</p>
