<h2>Creating sockets<br/></h2>
<h3>In C language:</h3>
<p>It is a means of communication, originally implemented by the University of Berkeley, between applications.</p>
<p>When using the "socket library" in C language, you should include the header files corresponding to this system library and the constants used.</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre class="brush: c;">
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
	</pre>
</div>
<p>The first step is to create a socket via the system call:</p>
<div class="code">
	<pre class="brush: c;">
int socket (int domaine, int type, int protocole);
	</pre>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>the first parameter is the domain. It is an integer which can take as its value one of the following constants:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>AF_INET</strong>: to work with IPv4 as network layer.</li>
		<li><strong>AF_INET6</strong>: to work with IPv6 as network layer.</li>
		<li><strong>AF_PACKET</strong>: to operate directly above the link layer (layer 2) without using the implementation of a network layer (layer 3) of the kernel.</li>
		<li><strong>AF_UNIX</strong>: to work with unix sockets and have communication limited to processes residing on the same machine.<br/>
		In some cases, this constant is replaced by the synonym AF_LOCAL, which incidentally belongs to Posix terminology.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The second parameter is the type. It is an integer which can take as its value one of the following constants:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>SOCK_STREAM</strong>: the dialogue takes place in connected mode, with flow control from one end of the communication to the other.</li>
		<li><strong>SOCK_DGRAM</strong>: communication takes place without connection, by transmission of data packets (i.e. by exchange of "datagram").</li>
		<li><strong>SOCK_RAW</strong>: the socket will be used to communicate raw with the indicated protocol. This is what to use with the AF_PACKET domain value.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The third parameter is the transport protocol used. It is an integer which can take as its value one of the following constants:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>NULL: if the default protocol is chosen for the type of communication indicated.</li>
		<li><strong>IPPROTO_TCP</strong>: indicates the TCP protocol. This is the default if the type is SOCK_STREAM.</li>
		<li><strong>IPPROTO_UDP</strong>: indicates the UDP protocol. This is the default if the type is SOCK_DGRAM.</li>
		<li><strong>IPPROTO_ICMP</strong>: indicates the ICMP protocol. This is one of two values to choose when the domain is AF_INET (or AF_INET6) and the type is SOCK_RAW.</li>
		<li><strong>IPPROTO_RAW</strong>: indicates direct communication with the network layer of the indicated domain. This is one of two values to choose when the domain is AF_INET (or AF_INET6) and the type is SOCK_RAW.</li>
		<li>In the case of the AF_PACKET domain, the value of the protocol field will be indicated in the Ethernet frame. If you want to receive all frame types, you will use <strong>htons(ETH_P_ALL)</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The returned value is a positive or null integer corresponding to the number of the descriptor allocated by the socket that has just been created or a negative value to indicate an error:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>EMFILE</strong>: constant corresponding to a full file table in the kernel.</li>
		<li><strong>ENFILE</strong>: constant corresponding to the fact that the limit of the total number of open files on the system has been reached.</li>
		<li><strong>ENOMEM</strong>: constant corresponding to the fact that there is not enough space to allocate the necessary buffers. The socket cannot be created until enough resources are freed.</li>
		<li><strong>EINVAL</strong>: constant corresponding to a non-existent domain.</li>
		<li><strong>EPROTONOSUPPORT</strong>: constant corresponding to a type inconsistent with the protocol or the domain</li>
		<li><strong>EACCES</strong>: constant corresponding to the absence of authorization to create a socket of the requested type (for example AF_INET and SOCK_RAW).</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul><li>In this course, we will only use TCP or UDP internet sockets which are therefore created via one of the following two instructions: </li></ul>
<div class="code">
	<pre class="brush: c;">
fd_tcp = socket (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);
fd_udp = socket (AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP);
	</pre>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>We have only reserved the socket management memory in the kernel, no communication has yet been initiated.</li>
	<li>There is a library equivalent to the "socket library" for Windows: The "Winsock library" which basically works on the same principle.</li>
	<li>In languages like <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.sockets.php">PHP</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html">Python</a>, there are libraries interfacing with system functions.</li>
</ul>
<div class="code">
	<pre class="brush: php;">
$socket_tcp = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_TCP);
$socket_udp = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, SOL_UDP);
	</pre>
</div>
<br/>
<div class="code">
	<pre class="brush: python;">
sock_tcp = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock_udp = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
	</pre>
</div>
