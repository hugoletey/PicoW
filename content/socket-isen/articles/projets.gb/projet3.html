<h2>TFTP proxy topic<br></h2>
<h3>Presentation of the subject:</h3>
<p>TFTP is a relatively lightweight file transfer protocol defined by RFC 1350.</p>
<p>It uses the UDP protocol as the transport layer.</p>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>To create this proxy, you will therefore write a TFTP server which, instead of reading or writing the files on the partition, will simply act as a TFTP client for a second TFTP server.</li>
	<li>As TFTP client and TFTP server software, you can use "tftpd64.exe" under Windows or install the corresponding packages under Unix (Mac or Linux).</li>
</ul>
