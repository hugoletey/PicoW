<h2>ISEN4 Project - Network Programming<br></h2>
<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Implement the programming of an application communicating via internet sockets.</li>
	<li>Implementing the problem on the client side</li>
	<li>Implementing the problem on the server side</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The projects are to be carried out by teams of 3 to 4 students.</li>
	<li>The project objectives can be met by developing both a server application and a client application using the same application protocol. If we want to respond by developing a single application that therefore integrates both types of connection, we must turn to developing a proxy (i.e. a kind of relay between two applications).</li>
	<li>This proxy, using standardized protocols, we can test its operation in connection with existing client applications and server applications.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Submission:</h3>
<p>The project is due on Sunday, March 12, 2023 (before 11:59 p.m.). You will send me by email:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A reminder of the names and first names of the participants in the project group</li>
	<li>The source code of the project</li>
	<li>The YouTube URL of a video showing the operation of the project</li>
</ul>
